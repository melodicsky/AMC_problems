A cube with 3-inch edges is made using 27 cubes with 1-inch edges. Nineteen of the smaller cubes are white and eight are black. If the eight black cubes are placed at the corners of the larger cube, what fraction of the surface area of the larger cube is white? 
$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{9}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{4}{9}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{5}{9}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{19}{27}$

The surface area of the cube is $6(3)(3)=54$. Each of the eight black cubes has 3 faces on the outside, making $3(8)=24$ black faces. Therefore there are $54-24=30$ white faces. To find the ratio, we evaluate $\frac{30}{54}= \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{5}{9}}$.

We will deal with this part by part:
Part 1: 1/4 circumference of big circle= $\frac{2\pi r}{4}=\frac{\pi r}{2}=\frac{20\pi}{2}=10\pi$
Part 2: Big radius minus small radius= $20-10=10$
Part 3: 1/4 circumference of small circle= $\frac{\pi r}{2}=\frac{10\pi}{2}=5\pi$
Part 4: Diameter of small circle: $2*10=20$
Part 5: Same as part 3: $5\pi$
Part 6: Same as part 2: $10$
Total: $10\pi + 10 + 5\pi + 20 + 5\pi + 10 = \boxed{E = 20\pi + 40}$

By the Pythagorean Theorem, the radius of the larger circle turns out to be $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the larger circle is $(\sqrt{2})^2\pi = 2\pi$. Using the coordinate plane given, we find that the radius of each of the two semicircles to be 1. So, the area of the two semicircles is $1^2\pi=\pi$. Finally, the ratio of the combined areas of the two semicircles to the area of circle $O$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{2}}$.

What is the correct ordering of the three numbers, $10^8$, $5^{12}$, and $2^{24}$?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2^{24}<10^8<5^{12}\\ \textbf{(B)}\ 2^{24}<5^{12}<10^8 \\  \textbf{(C)}\ 5^{12}<2^{24}<10^8 \\ \textbf{(D)}\ 10^8<5^{12}<2^{24} \\ \textbf{(E)}\ 10^8<2^{24}<5^{12}$

Use brute force.
$10^8=100,000,000$, 
$5^{12}=244,140,625$, and
$2^{24}=16,777,216$.
Therefore, $\boxed{\text{(A)}2^{24}<10^8<5^{12}}$ is the answer.

Assume that the area of each square is $1$.  Then, the area of the bolded region in the top left square is $\frac{1}{4}$.  The area of the top right bolded region is $\frac{1}{8}$.  The area of the bottom left bolded region is $\frac{3}{8}$.  And the area of the bottom right bolded region is $\frac{1}{4}$.  Add the four fractions:  $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{4} = 1$.  The four squares together have an area of $4$, so the percentage bolded is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 100 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 25}$.

Marla has a large white cube that has an edge of 10 feet. She also has enough green paint to cover 300 square feet. Marla uses all the paint to create a white square centered on each face, surrounded by a green border. What is the area of one of the white squares, in square feet?
$\textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}5\sqrt2\qquad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}10\qquad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}10\sqrt2\qquad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}50\qquad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}50\sqrt2$

If Marla evenly distributes her $300$ square feet of paint between the 6 faces, each face will get $300\div6 = 50$ square feet of paint. The surface area of one of the faces of the cube is $10^2 = 100$ square feet. Therefore, there will be $100-50 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 50}$ square feet of white on each side.
